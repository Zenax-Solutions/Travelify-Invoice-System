# Bug Fix Report - Dashboard Widget Issues

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing View File
**Error:** `View [filament.widgets.comprehensive-financial-overview] not found`

**Solution:** Created the missing Blade view file at:
- `resources/views/filament/widgets/comprehensive-financial-overview.blade.php`
- Used proper Filament widget structure with grid layout for financial metrics

### 2. Database Column Error
**Error:** `SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'status' in 'where clause' (Connection: mysql, SQL: select sum(amount) as aggregate from payments where payment_date between 2025-07-01 00:00:00 and 2025-07-31 23:59:59 and status = completed)`

**Root Cause:** The `Payment` model doesn't have a `status` column in the database schema.

**Solution:** Removed all `status` filters from Payment queries in:
- `app/Filament/Widgets/FinancialOverview.php`
- Updated revenue calculations to sum all payments instead of filtering by status

### 3. Missing Relationship Method
**Error:** `Call to undefined method App\Models\Service::invoiceItems()`

**Root Cause:** The system uses a many-to-many relationship between services and invoices through the `invoice_service` pivot table, not a separate `invoice_items` table.

**Solution:** Updated widgets to use correct relationships:
- Fixed `ServiceProfitabilityTable.php` to use `invoice_service` pivot table
- Updated `RevenueBreakdownChart.php` to use correct table joins

### 4. Missing Database Table
**Error:** `SQLSTATE[42S02]: Base table or view not found: 1146 Table 'travelify_invoice.invoice_items' doesn't exist`

**Root Cause:** Widgets were referencing non-existent `invoice_items` table.

**Solution:** Updated all widgets to use the correct database structure:
- Services and invoices are linked via `invoice_service` pivot table
- Updated calculations to use `invoice_service.quantity * invoice_service.unit_price`

### 5. Non-existent Column in Order Clause
**Error:** `SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'days_overdue' in 'order clause'`

**Root Cause:** OutstandingPaymentsTable was trying to sort by a calculated field that doesn't exist in the database.

**Solution:** Changed default sorting to use existing `invoice_date` column instead of `days_overdue`

### 6. Field Name Inconsistencies
**Issues:** 
- Using `total` instead of `total_amount` 
- Using `remaining_balance` instead of calculated field

**Solutions:**
- Fixed field references in `FinancialOverview.php` to use `total_amount`
- Updated `OutstandingPaymentsTable.php` to calculate remaining balance as `total_amount - total_paid`
- Fixed `ComprehensiveFinancialOverview.php` calculations to use proper field names

## Files Modified

### 1. Created New File
```
resources/views/filament/widgets/comprehensive-financial-overview.blade.php
```

### 2. Updated Files
```
app/Filament/Widgets/FinancialOverview.php
app/Filament/Widgets/ComprehensiveFinancialOverview.php  
app/Filament/Widgets/OutstandingPaymentsTable.php
app/Filament/Widgets/ServiceProfitabilityTable.php
app/Filament/Widgets/RevenueBreakdownChart.php
```

## Database Schema Validation

Confirmed correct field usage:
- **Payments**: `amount`, `payment_date`, `payment_method` (no `status` field)
- **Invoices**: `total_amount`, `total_paid` (no `total` or `remaining_balance` fields)
- **Purchase Orders**: `total_amount`, `total_paid` (no `total` or `remaining_balance` fields)

## Testing Results

**✅ All Issues Resolved**
