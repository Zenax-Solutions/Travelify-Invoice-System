# Tour Supplier Credit Limit Management System

## Overview
This document outlines the complete implementation of the credit limit management system for tour suppliers (vendors) in the Travelify travel agency management system.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Credit Limit Tracking & Calculations
**File:** `app/Models/Vendor.php`

- **Credit Usage Percentage**: Calculates how much of the credit limit is currently being used
- **Outstanding Balance**: Tracks the total unpaid amount from all purchase orders
- **Available Credit**: Shows remaining credit available for new orders
- **Over Limit Detection**: Identifies vendors who have exceeded their credit limits
- **Currency Conversion**: Helper methods to convert LKR to USD (configurable exchange rate)

**New Methods Added:**
```php
getOutstandingBalanceAttribute()      // Total unpaid amount in USD
getCreditUsagePercentageAttribute()   // Percentage of credit limit used
isOverCreditLimitAttribute()          // Boolean check for over-limit status
getAvailableCreditAttribute()         // Remaining available credit
convertLkrToUsd($amount)             // Currency conversion helper
wouldExceedCreditLimit($lkrAmount)   // Check if new order would exceed limit
getCreditLimitOverage($lkrAmount)    // Calculate overage amount
```

### 2. Visual Progress Indicators
**File:** `app/Filament/Resources/VendorResource.php`
**File:** `resources/views/filament/columns/credit-progress-bar.blade.php`

- **Progress Bar Column**: Visual representation of credit usage with color coding
  - 🟢 Green: 0-74% usage (Safe)
  - 🟡 Yellow: 75-89% usage (Caution)
  - 🔴 Red: 90%+ usage (Danger)
- **Outstanding Balance Column**: Shows current debt with color coding
- **Credit Limit Display**: Shows limit in USD format with proper formatting

### 3. Purchase Order Credit Validation
**File:** `app/Filament/Resources/PurchaseOrderResource.php`

#### Form Enhancements:
- **Vendor Selection Helper Text**: Shows real-time credit usage and warnings
- **Credit Information Section**: Expandable section showing detailed credit status
- **Total Amount Validation**: Real-time validation with warnings and error messages
- **Credit Impact Display**: Shows how the order affects credit usage

#### Table Enhancements:
- **Credit Risk Indicators**: Shows risk level in vendor name description
- **Credit Impact Column**: Badge showing percentage impact of each order
- **USD Conversion**: Shows LKR amounts converted to USD for context

### 4. Credit Limit Enforcement
**File:** `app/Filament/Resources/PurchaseOrderResource/Pages/CreatePurchaseOrder.php`
**File:** `app/Filament/Resources/PurchaseOrderResource/Pages/EditPurchaseOrder.php`

#### Create Order Protection:
- **Pre-Creation Validation**: Prevents orders that exceed credit limits
- **Warning Notifications**: Shows warnings when approaching credit limits (90%+)
- **Blocking Mechanism**: Completely blocks order creation if limit would be exceeded

#### Edit Order Protection:
- **Update Validation**: Checks credit impact when modifying existing orders
- **Differential Calculation**: Only considers the change in amount, not total
- **Smart Notifications**: Context-aware warnings for order modifications

## User Experience Features

### 1. Real-Time Feedback
- **Live Validation**: Form fields update in real-time as users enter data
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded progress bars and status indicators
- **Helper Text**: Contextual information displayed near form fields

### 2. Comprehensive Warnings
- **Three-Tier Warning System**:
  - ✅ **Safe (Green)**: Under 75% usage
  - ⚠️ **Caution (Yellow)**: 75-89% usage with warnings
  - 🚫 **Danger (Red)**: 90%+ usage with blocking

### 3. Detailed Information Display
- **Credit Status Section**: Expandable section with complete credit overview
- **Impact Calculations**: Shows exactly how each order affects credit usage
- **Currency Context**: LKR amounts shown with USD equivalents

## Technical Implementation

### Currency Conversion
- **Exchange Rate**: Currently set to 1 USD = 320 LKR (configurable)
- **Conversion Logic**: Centralized in Vendor model for consistency
- **Future Enhancement**: Can be made configurable via settings table

### Validation Logic
```php
// Example validation flow:
1. User selects vendor → Load credit information
2. User enters order amount → Calculate USD equivalent
3. System checks: current_balance + new_amount > credit_limit?
4. If yes → Show error, prevent save
5. If no but > 90% → Show warning, allow save
6. If < 90% → Show success message
```

### Database Relationships
- **Vendor ↔ PurchaseOrder**: One-to-many relationship for credit calculations
- **Real-time Calculations**: Credit usage calculated from live purchase order data
- **No Additional Tables**: Uses existing structure efficiently

## Usage Instructions

### For Travel Managers:
1. **Set Credit Limits**: Edit vendor profiles to set USD credit limits
2. **Monitor Usage**: Use progress bars in vendor list to monitor credit usage
3. **Review Warnings**: Pay attention to yellow/red indicators
4. **Manage Orders**: System will prevent over-limit orders automatically

### For Travel Consultants:
1. **Order Creation**: System guides through credit-safe order creation
2. **Warning Response**: Heed warnings about high credit usage
3. **Contact Suppliers**: For credit limit increases when needed

### For Financial Controllers:
1. **Credit Oversight**: Monitor all vendor credit usage from vendor list
2. **Risk Assessment**: Use color-coded indicators for risk evaluation
3. **Report Generation**: Export vendor data with credit status information

## Error Handling

### Validation Errors:
- **Over-Limit Orders**: Clear error messages with specific overage amounts
- **Form Blocking**: Prevents submission until issues are resolved
- **Persistent Notifications**: Critical errors remain visible until addressed

### User Notifications:
- **Success Messages**: Confirmation when orders are safely created
- **Warning Messages**: Proactive alerts for high credit usage
- **Error Messages**: Clear explanations when limits are exceeded

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements:
1. **Configurable Exchange Rates**: Admin panel for currency rate management
2. **Email Notifications**: Automated alerts for credit limit warnings
3. **Credit History**: Detailed tracking of credit usage over time
4. **Automated Reports**: Scheduled reports for credit status
5. **Multiple Currencies**: Support for different vendor currencies
6. **Credit Approval Workflow**: Manager approval for over-limit orders

## Files Modified

### Core Files:
- `app/Models/Vendor.php` - Credit calculation methods
- `app/Filament/Resources/VendorResource.php` - Progress bar display
- `app/Filament/Resources/PurchaseOrderResource.php` - Form validation & table display

### Page Controllers:
- `app/Filament/Resources/PurchaseOrderResource/Pages/CreatePurchaseOrder.php`
- `app/Filament/Resources/PurchaseOrderResource/Pages/EditPurchaseOrder.php`

### View Components:
- `resources/views/filament/columns/credit-progress-bar.blade.php`

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Scenarios:
1. **Normal Orders**: Create orders within credit limits
2. **Warning Triggers**: Create orders that trigger 90%+ warnings
3. **Limit Exceeded**: Attempt to create orders exceeding limits
4. **Order Modifications**: Edit existing orders to test differential calculations
5. **Vendor Switching**: Change vendors in forms to test dynamic updates
6. **No Credit Limit**: Test behavior with vendors without credit limits

### Expected Behaviors:
- ✅ Orders under 75% usage: No warnings, smooth creation
- ⚠️ Orders 75-89% usage: Warning shown, creation allowed
- 🚫 Orders 90%+ usage: Strong warning, creation allowed
- ❌ Orders over limit: Error shown, creation blocked
