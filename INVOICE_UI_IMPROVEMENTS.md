- **View Invoice** - Opens invoice in new tab with info color

#### **Documents Group** (Document operations)  
- **Download PDF** - PDF generation with info color
- **Send Email** - Email functionality with warning color (only visible if customer has email)

#### **Financial Group** (Financial operations)
- **Process Refund** - Complete refund processing with warning color and comprehensive form
- **Cancel Invoice** - Invoice cancellation with danger color and confirmation requirements

### 2. Enhanced Bulk Actions
Organized bulk operations into logical groups:

## UI/UX Improvements

- **Button Sizing**: Consistent small size for compact table display

### User Experience Enhancements

### Form Improvements

- **Refund Forms**: Complete refund workflow with method selection and reason tracking

## Technical Implementation

### Code Structure
```php
// Action Groups Pattern
Tables\Actions\ActionGroup::make([
    // Related actions grouped together
])
->label('Group Name')
->icon('heroicon-icon')
->size('sm')
->color('gray')
->button()
```

### Key Features
- **Consistent Naming**: Clear, descriptive labels for all actions

## Benefits Achieved

## Consistency Achieved
Both Purchase Order Resource and Invoice Resource now feature identical UI patterns:

- Enhanced bulk actions with proper grouping
- Consistent color coding and iconography
- Similar confirmation patterns and user feedback

## Files Modified
